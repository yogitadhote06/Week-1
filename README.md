Carbon Dioxide Emissions Prediction
PROJECT TITLE: Carbon Dioxide Emmisions Prediction Rate

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Accurate prediction of CO₂ emission rates is critical for informing climate policy, optimizing energy strategies, and enhancing disaster preparedness. However, existing models often struggle with integrating real-time data, accounting for socio-economic variables, and adapting to regional disparities. This project aims to develop a robust, data-driven model to forecast CO₂ emission rates with higher precision, enabling proactive climate action and improved disaster management planning.

DESCRIPTION: This Project uses a dataset consisting of Carbon Dioxide emitted by different vehicles in a city (like Cannada).the model will focus on predicting CO2 emissions prediction rate so that rate could be taken into account for further processing for reducing CO2 emissions.
